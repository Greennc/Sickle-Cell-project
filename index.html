<h1>Sickle Cell Disease: <br> Quick Facts</h1>
<div class="Info">

  <h2>What is Sickle Cell Disease </h2>
  <p>Sickle Cell Disease is a group genetic disorders that affect red blood cells in the body.
  The red blood cells take on a unhealty sickle shape (hence the name) that makes it harder to
  transport oxygen throughout the body. The most common Sickle Cell Disease is Sickle Cell Anemia.</p>

<h2>How is Sickle Cell Anemia transferred?</h2>
<p>Sickle Cell is caused by a gene mutation and is passed by autosomal recessive inheritance.
This means both parents must have the trait to pass it to a child.  If both parents have
the trait, then the child will have the disorder.</p>
<p>It is worth nothing that Sickle Cell Anemia grew out of an evolutionary resistance to Malaria.
In the United States, African Americans are mostly affected but it is found in populations and descendents
of Sub-Sahara African, Mediterranean, and Indian people.  </p>
